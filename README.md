#MyTodo
An Android project created for the purpose of teaching myself Android programming.

This particular branch adds dual pane view for the application in landscape mode on any Android device.

##Known issues
* When viewing a task and rotating from landscape to portrait, pressing the back-key in portrait mode shows an empty view.
* When rotating from landscape to portrait the activity stack increases and it takes "number of rotations" minus 1 back key presses to exit the application.
